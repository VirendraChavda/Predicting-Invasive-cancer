# Predicting-Invasive-cancer

## Overview
This machine learning project aims at predicting invasive and non-invasive cancer from gene expression data.
In this project, many techniques is being used as the number of rows are very less and number of columns is large. 
Resampling methods such as cross validation and bootstrap, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as Lasso feature selection, t-test based feature selection are used. 
For feature creation, non-supervised techniques such as k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering are used.
